## Workshop Introduction

The main goal of this workshop is to introduce the desktop GUI library called `PySimpleGUI`. The workshop will be of maximum 3 hours duration and will be done in different sections to ensure that there is a steady progress from one section to another.

The python standard installation has a desktop GUI library called `Tkinter` that can be used to build desktop applications but is not user friendly like other desktop GUI packages like Qt or wxPython. Using any of these packages requires non-trivial investment of your time and energy to get a decent looking desktop application up and running.

This is where PySimgleGUI can come in handy. It is touted as an easy to use and adapt library to quickly get someone up and running when it comes to building a desktop app especially for a standalone python script. This package wraps all the aforementioned desktop packages to provide an unified API that is easy to use and maintain. There are also plenty of examples available online which can be used to quickly bootstrap a desktop GUI.

Through the course of the workshop, we will be developing a simplified version of Docker Desktop with the following features:

* Manage docker images: View and download
* Manage containers: Start, view and logging
* Save user settings
